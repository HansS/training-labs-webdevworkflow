Web Developer's Toolbox Lab Project
----

This repository contains a base skeleton to be used during the "Web Developer's 
Toolbox" (or "Web Developer's Workflow") training class given by 
[appendTo](http://appendto.com).

## How to use this repository

The `master` branch of this repository holds the skeleton of a possible in-progress 
front end project. The various other branches include possible solutions for 
specific labs within the training course. Thus, if you were to simply look at the 
_testing-with-qunit_ branch you would see how the training content lab was 
implemented in the instructor's solution.

There is also a `final-solution` branch which includes all completed lab content. 
Note that most branches do use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) for task running, even 
though that may not be the purpose of that lab. Thus you may want to look at the 
`task-running-with-grunt` branch first.
